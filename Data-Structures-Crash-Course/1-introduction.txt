Why Are Data Structure Needed

The premise that tech companies operate under is that coding interviews are a good way to test whether the interviewee is a good problem solver

The coding inteviews do not require much theoretical knowledge, the questions could generally be given to someone with no coding knowledge and this person could still solve them conceptually.
They would be able to understand and tackle them

This does not mean they do not require any theoretical knowledge

Requirements: 
  - Some Foundation in Programming
  - Data Structures 

Data Structures are the tools to solve algorhythmic problems

There are entire academic fields dedicated towards Data structures and their mathmatical basis

In the context of coding interviews => You do not need that much knowledge about data structures, It is focused around a few foundational Data structures.

Data Structures are the foundational building blocks you need to tackle coding interview problems and your problem solving ability will help you identify how you need to apply this knowledge.
